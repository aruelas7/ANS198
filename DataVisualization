# Grammar of graphics
# Layer 1: Data
ggplot(data=dogs)

#Layer 2: GEOmetery -shapes to represent data
ggplot(data=dogs) + geom_point()

#Layer 3: AESthetic - "wires" between geometry and data
ggplot(data=dogs) + geom_point(aes(x = datadog, y = popularity))
ggplot(data=dogs) + geom_point(aes(x = height, y= weight))

#equivalently
ggplot(data=dogs, aes(x = datadog, y = popularity)) + geom_point()

#Add another geom to add breed names to the plot
ggplot(data=dogs, aes(x = datadog, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_text(aes(label = breed))
